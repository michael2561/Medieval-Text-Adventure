Michael A.'s first Python program.

I'm starting this off simple, and may make it more complex as time goes on.

To begin, it will be an option-selecting text adventure.
I.e. A. Run B. Hide with a raw_input prompt looking for either "A", "Run", "B", or "Hide".
It will return an error for any other input.

After I get that down, I will attempt to change it to use a text parser Ã  la Zork.

Maybe eventually, I will attempt something more complex (potentially even a GUI), 
but for now, I need to stay focused and try for these goals.

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
