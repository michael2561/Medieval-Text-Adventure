Michael A.'s first Python program.

I'm starting this off simple, and may make it more complex as time goes on.

To begin, it will be a simple option-selecting text adventure. Simple, yes, but your choices will matter. The goal is to have many, many different endings and subplots. Hopefully, the story will be different on any playthrough.
I.e. "A. Run or B. Hide" with a raw_input prompt looking for either "A", "Run", "B", or "Hide".
It will return an error for any other input.

After that, I will enrich the story.

Then, I will attempt to change the format to use a text parser Ã  la Zork.

And maybe eventually, I will attempt something more complex (potentially even a GUI), 
but for now, I need to stay focused and try for these goals.

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
